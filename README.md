## Usage

To use this project, you'll need a text editor and a web browser installed on your computer. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your text editor and the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as your web browser.

To customize the website with your own content:

1. Open the project directory in your favorite code editor.
2. Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to include your own content and styling.
3. Save your changes and refresh the index.html file in your web browser to preview the changes.
4. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit and push them to your GitHub repository.

```
it add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
git push
```
5. Your changes will now be live on your portfolio website!

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your portfolio website code to it.
2. Enable GitHub Pages or create a new site on Heroku.
3. Follow the instructions provided by the hosting service to configure your site settings and deploy your website.
